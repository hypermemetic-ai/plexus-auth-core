## [0.3.0]

Release with plexus-core 0.8.0 (BIDIR-6, BIDIR-17: a method's input half).

### Breaking

| Change | Before (0.2.2) | After | What to do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duplex::CallCeiling` | `credit`, `max_items`, `max_bytes` | adds the public field `max_buffered`: the bytes one call may hold at once, past which the callee grants no more credit (never a refusal) | Name it in a struct literal, or use `..Default::default()` |
| `CallCeiling::default()` | `max_items` 1,000,000, `max_bytes` 64 MiB | `max_items` and `max_bytes` are `u64::MAX` (no lifetime limit unless a method opts in); `max_buffered` 64 MiB; `credit` 64 | Set `max_items` or `max_bytes` for a method that wants a lifetime limit |
| `duplex::DuplexRefusalCode` | eight variants | adds `OutOfSequence` (`out_of_sequence`) and `InvalidInput` (`invalid_input`) | Add them to an exhaustive match |

### Added

- `duplex::DEFAULT_INPUT_WINDOW` (64): the credit a method grants unless it
  says otherwise.
- `duplex::DEFAULT_MAX_BUFFERED` (64 MiB): the bytes one call may hold unless
  its method says otherwise.

### Changed

- `AuditRecord::duplex_refused` records `OutOfSequence` and `InvalidInput` as
  `AuditDenyReason::NotAccepted`.
